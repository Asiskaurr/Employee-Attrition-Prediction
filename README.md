# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing HR datasets to identify factors influencing employee attrition and building a predictive model.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning: handled missing values and categorical encoding.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): visualized attrition trends by role, age, and satisfaction.
3. Correlation Analysis: studied feature importance across employee demographics.
4. Model Development: trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict attrition.
5. Evaluation: assessed model performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Results
- Identified key drivers of attrition, including age, job role, and satisfaction levels.
- Built a predictive model to provide actionable workforce insights.
